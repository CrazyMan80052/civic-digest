## 2024-09-04 - Modal Close Button Accessibility
**Learning:** Found several modal/drawer components using icon-only (<X />) buttons for closing without aria-labels, making them inaccessible to screen readers.
**Action:** Always ensure icon-only buttons have descriptive aria-labels (e.g., aria-label="Close") to maintain accessibility across the design system.

## 2024-09-05 - React Hook Positioning in Modals
**Learning:** Early returns (e.g., `if (!isOpen) return null;`) placed before `useState` or `useEffect` hook calls violate React's Rules of Hooks and cause runtime errors when modal visibility toggles.
**Action:** Always declare all hooks at the very top of the functional component before any conditional rendering or early returns.

## 2024-09-05 - Async Scraper In-Memory Fallback
**Learning:** In dev and CI environments, PostgreSQL may not always be running or accessible. Crashing on DB failure halts scraper runs.
**Action:** Always wrap DB operations with fallback mechanisms so scrapers return parsed OCD-ID records in-memory if DB transactions fail.

## 2024-09-05 - Runtime Discipline with Bun
**Learning:** Using npm/yarn/pnpm in `frontend/` causes conflicting lockfiles and breaks Turbopack caches.
**Action:** Exclusively use `bun` commands (`bun install`, `bun dev`, `bun run build`, `bun test`) in the frontend directory.

## 2024-05-14 - Accessible Form Controls in Next.js Components
**Learning:** Found that custom dropdowns (`<select>`) and utility buttons (like a search clear "✕" button) in `Navbar.tsx` were missing accessible names. Screen readers rely on `aria-label` when visual labels are omitted or placed via icons without text alternatives.
**Action:** Always add explicit `aria-label` attributes to `<input>`, `<select>`, and icon-only `<button>` elements in interactive components.
## 2025-02-23 - Bot Moderation Studio Action Button Loading States
**Learning:** Async moderation actions in the Bot Moderation Studio lacked visual feedback (loading spinners) when submitting, which could lead to user confusion or accidental double-submissions while waiting for the server response. Additionally, handling complex interactive Playwright verifications requires route interception to reliably capture transient UI states like a loading spinner.
**Action:** When adding async operations to interactive modals, ensure buttons are bound to a loading state (`isLoading`) that replaces the default icon with a spinning loader (e.g., `<RefreshCw className="animate-spin" />`) and reduces the button opacity to visually indicate a disabled state.
